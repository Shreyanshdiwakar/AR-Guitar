# ARKit 3 Body Tracking: AR Guitar Demo
ARKit 3 + Body Tracking = An invisible AR guitar that plays different sounds when strummed based on the position of the left hand along the invisible guitar's neck.

This project was a quick dive into RealityKit and ARKit 3's Body Tracking (i.e. ARBodyTrackingConfiguration) to explore body-based controls.



## To Play the AR Guitar
1. Run the app and point it at a person
2. Hold the left hand up along the invisible guitar's neck
3. Strum with the right hand
4. Move the left hand to select different sounds
5. Strum with the right hand again
