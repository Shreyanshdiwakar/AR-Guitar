# AR-Guitar
ARKit 3 + Body Tracking = An invisible AR guitar that plays different sounds when strummed based on the position of the left hand along the invisible guitar's neck.  This project was a quick dive into RealityKit and ARKit 3's Body Tracking (i.e. ARBodyTrackingConfiguration) to explore body-based controls.
